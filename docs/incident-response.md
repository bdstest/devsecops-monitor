# Incident Response Playbooks

## Overview

Comprehensive incident response procedures for DevSecOps security events, automated response capabilities, and escalation workflows.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels
- **Critical (P1)**: Active security breach, data exfiltration, ransomware
- **High (P2)**: Confirmed malware, privilege escalation, system compromise  
- **Medium (P3)**: Suspicious activity, policy violations, failed authentication
- **Low (P4)**: Informational alerts, configuration drift, minor vulnerabilities

## Automated Response Matrix

| Incident Type | Severity | Automated Actions | Manual Actions Required |
|---------------|----------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Malware Detection | Critical | Host isolation, user notification | Forensic analysis, root cause |
| Data Exfiltration | Critical | Network blocking, data classification | Legal notification, impact assessment |
| Brute Force Attack | High | Account lockout, IP blocking | User notification, credential reset |
| Vulnerability Exploit | High | Patch deployment, system hardening | Vulnerability assessment update |
| Policy Violation | Medium | Alert generation, compliance report | Policy review, user training |
| Failed Authentication | Low | Rate limiting, monitoring increase | User account review |

## Forensic Procedures

### Evidence Collection
```bash
# Network evidence
tcpdump -i eth0 -w /evidence/network_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).pcap

# System memory dump
dd if=/dev/mem of=/evidence/memory_dump_$(hostname)_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).img

# Disk imaging
dd if=/dev/sda of=/evidence/disk_image_$(hostname)_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).img bs=4096 conv=noerror,sync

# Log collection
tar -czf /evidence/logs_$(hostname)_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).tar.gz /var/log/

# Hash verification
sha256sum /evidence/* > /evidence/checksums.txt
```

### Chain of Custody
```json
{
  "evidence_id": "EVD-2024-001",
  "incident_id": "INC-2024-07-20-001",
  "collection_date": "2024-07-20T10:30:00Z",
  "collected_by": "Security Analyst",
  "evidence_type": "Network Traffic",
  "file_path": "/evidence/network_20240720_103000.pcap",
  "file_hash": "a1b2c3d4e5f6...",
  "chain_of_custody": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-07-20T10:30:00Z",
      "action": "collected",
      "person": "John Doe",
      "location": "Security Operations Center"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Integration Workflows

### SOAR Platform Integration
```python
# SOAR workflow automation
class SOARIntegration:
    def trigger_workflow(self, incident_data):
        workflow_id = self.determine_workflow(incident_data['type'])
        
        return {
            'workflow_id': workflow_id,
            'triggered_at': datetime.utcnow(),
            'expected_completion': self.calculate_completion_time(workflow_id),
            'automated_actions': self.get_automated_actions(workflow_id)
        }
    
    def update_incident_status(self, incident_id, status):
        # Update external ticketing systems
        self.update_jira_ticket(incident_id, status)
        self.update_servicenow_incident(incident_id, status)
        
    def escalate_incident(self, incident_id, escalation_level):
        if escalation_level == 'executive':
            self.notify_executives(incident_id)
        elif escalation_level == 'legal':
            self.notify_legal_team(incident_id)
        elif escalation_level == 'external':
            self.engage_external_experts(incident_id)
```

### Threat Intelligence Enrichment
```python
# Real-time threat intelligence correlation
def enrich_incident_with_threat_intel(incident):
    enrichment = {}
    
    # Check IOCs against threat feeds
    if 'ip_address' in incident:
        threat_data = threat_intel_api.lookup_ip(incident['ip_address'])
        enrichment['ip_reputation'] = threat_data
    
    # Check file hashes
    if 'file_hash' in incident:
        malware_data = virustotal_api.lookup_hash(incident['file_hash'])
        enrichment['malware_analysis'] = malware_data
    
    # Check domains
    if 'domain' in incident:
        domain_data = threat_intel_api.lookup_domain(incident['domain'])
        enrichment['domain_reputation'] = domain_data
    
    return {**incident, 'threat_intelligence': enrichment}
```
